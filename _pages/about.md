Hello and welcome. I‚Äôm Festus Adegbola, a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Geography at the University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/geography/about-us.html), where I specialize in Earth Systems Science with a focus on biodiversity monitoring, remote sensing, and environmental change.

Current Work 
======

My research examines how ecological patterns‚Äîparticularly bird species distributions‚Äîare shaped by habitat structure, climate variability, and human disturbance. I integrate advanced tools such as lidar, hyperspectral imagery, and acoustic monitoring to map fine-scale habitat traits and assess their influence on species richness.

I currently serve as a NASA FINESST Fellow and contribute to research efforts within the [BioSCape](https://www.bioscape.io) and [BioSoundScape](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/aaa4835da57c4405b4dfd3a03d3ae2c7) projects, initiatives aimed at enhancing biodiversity monitoring through innovative remote sensing and modeling approaches. My work supports science-informed conservation and environmental policy, both in the U.S. and globally.

Beyond research, I‚Äôm an active teacher, mentor, and advocate for scientific communication, with a strong commitment to fostering equitable access to environmental data and decision-making tools. I am also a professional musician (I play the keys üéπ and alto sax üé∑)

This website gives an overview of my academic journey, research projects, publications, opportunities for collaboration, and my hobbies. Thank you for visiting‚ÄîI invite you to explore and connect.


How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
